# Parsing Example

## Goal

Parsing Context-related texts for the API out of the source of each page.

## Example 1

    <p>This is an example.</p>

A very simple example. A single sentence without reference to others. Used 1:1 like this for the API.

## Example 2

    <p>I am a simple sample text about a baker. This baker bakes his rolls fresh every morning.</p>
    <p>But how do the rolls get into the oven?</p>
    <p>He pushes all the rolls onto a large shove and heaves them into the oven. Strong performance.</p>
